A simple Python script that interfaces with the Alpha Vantage API for information about stock prices. This is a copy of another repository
(Stock analysis) that will be merged later on once this app is complete. It uses Dash for the front end design components, and plotly.

The project has a discord chat here:

https://discord.gg/3tXJQg


I also have a group me chat going that I am quicker to respond to, pm me on reddit for more info. 

Here's where the project is at right now: 
-Takes command line input for a stock choice as well as a type of function to display the data as
-Returns a dashboard with a line graph and a candlestick graph of the same data
-Has a non-functioning dash dropdown/select bar for selecting the stock symbol and type of function to reload the graphs with new
information
-Select bar is loaded with all the stock symbols from the NSDQ and NYSE

Here are my goals for the project (Not necessarily in any order): 
-Change the callback functions so that the dropdown menus actually can change the graph display
-Shift from command line input to user interface input on the dashboard
-Fix the UI so that it has several tabs for different graphs
-Eventually do somesort of datamining with Tensorflow

I'm working full time right now, so the updates for this might be a little slow because my attention will be split between a few different
projects, but I'll try and do at least one update a day if I can.
